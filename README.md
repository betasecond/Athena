# Athena: AI Customer Service Agent for Logistics

**Athena** is an advanced AI-powered customer service agent meticulously designed to address the unique challenges and demands of the **logistics industry**. It leverages state-of-the-art **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** capabilities and a core architecture built for **continual learning**, ensuring it becomes more knowledgeable and efficient over time.

Our vision for Athena is to provide intelligent, adaptive, and context-aware support, streamlining customer interactions and improving operational efficiency within logistics operations.

## Core Features

* **Continual Learning Engine:** Athena is not static. Through a dedicated manual review interface (similar to the one prototyped in `review_page_tailwind` artifact), new knowledge, corrected answers, and evolving industry nuances are seamlessly integrated. This allows Athena to:
    * Improve accuracy based on real-world interactions and feedback.
    * Adapt to new services, regulations, and terminologies in the logistics sector.
    * Continuously expand its understanding of customer intents and queries.
* **Logistics Industry Specialization:** Trained and designed with a deep understanding of logistics workflows, common queries (e.g., shipment tracking, customs clearance, warehousing issues, delivery exceptions, freight quoting), and industry-specific terminology.
* **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Athena utilizes a RAG pipeline to:
    * Access and retrieve relevant information from an up-to-date knowledge base (which includes your initial CSV data and all continuously learned and approved information).
    * Generate accurate, informative, and contextually appropriate responses, going beyond simple pre-programmed scripts.
* **Intelligent Customer Support:**
    * Handles a wide spectrum of customer inquiries, from simple FAQs to more complex problem-solving.
    * Aims to understand user intent, even with ambiguous phrasing or colloquial language.
    * Provides consistent, reliable, and up-to-date information.

## How Continual Learning is Achieved

The continual learning loop is a cornerstone of Athena's intelligence:

1.  **Initial Knowledge Seeding:** The system is bootstrapped with an initial dataset. This can be your provided CSV containing common logistics-related questions and their ideal answers, company policies, service descriptions, etc.
2.  **User Interaction & Candidate Identification:** As users interact with Athena, the system identifies:
    * Questions it couldn't answer confidently.
    * Answers that received negative feedback from users (if such a mechanism is implemented).
    * Interactions where the system's confidence score was low.
    * New, unseen query patterns.
3.  **Manual Review & Enrichment via UI:** These identified candidates for learning are presented in a dedicated **Manual Review UI** (as prototyped in the `review_page_tailwind` artifact). Human reviewers (e.g., logistics experts, senior customer service agents) can:
    * Validate or correct Athena's proposed answers.
    * Provide new, authoritative answers to previously unanswerable questions.
    * Refine existing knowledge entries for clarity or accuracy.
    * Categorize or tag information for better future retrieval.
4.  **Knowledge Base Augmentation (Backend Service):** Once an item is reviewed and approved in the UI, the backend service (`AthenaService` or your chosen name) processes this curated information:
    * The approved question-answer pair (or knowledge snippet) is cleaned and structured.
    * It's converted into a vector embedding using a sentence transformer model.
    * This new embedding, along with its source text and metadata, is **incrementally indexed** into Athena's vector database.
5.  **Enhanced RAG Performance:** The RAG system can now immediately leverage this newly added and verified knowledge. The next time a similar query is received, the RAG component is more likely to retrieve this high-quality information, leading to improved response accuracy and relevance. This iterative process ensures Athena continuously adapts and improves.

## Technology Stack (Conceptual)

* **Backend Service (`AthenaService`):** Python (e.g., FastAPI, Flask, Django)
    * API endpoints for the review UI (fetching pending items, submitting reviewed items).
    * Logic for processing and embedding new knowledge.
    * Interaction with the primary database and vector database.
* **AI/ML Components:**
    * **Large Language Models (LLMs):** For the generative part of RAG (e.g., GPT series, Claude, open-source models like Llama, Mistral, or Qwen).
    * **Text Embedding Models:** For converting text to vectors (e.g., models from `sentence-transformers`, OpenAI embeddings, or other providers).
    * **RAG Orchestration:** Custom logic or frameworks (like LangChain or LlamaIndex) to manage the retrieval and generation flow.
* **Data Storage:**
    * **Primary Database:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) for storing user interaction logs, review item metadata (status, reviewer, timestamps), and potentially user accounts for the review UI.
    * **Vector Database:** (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate) for storing text embeddings and enabling efficient semantic search for the RAG system.
* **Frontend (Review UI):** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript (as prototyped in `review_page_tailwind`).

## Getting Started

*(This section will be filled out as the project develops. It would typically include instructions on environment setup, installing dependencies, running the backend service, and accessing the review UI.)*

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python (version specified in `pyproject.toml`)
    * Access to an LLM (API key or local setup)
    * Vector Database instance (local or cloud)
2.  **Installation:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd athena
    pip install -e . # Or pip install -r requirements.txt if you generate one
    ```
3.  **Configuration:**
    * Set up environment variables for API keys, database connections, etc. (e.g., in a `.env` file).
4.  **Running the Service:**
    ```bash
    # Example for FastAPI
    uvicorn athena.main:app --reload
    ```

## Future Roadmap

* Advanced analytics on reviewed data and agent performance.
* Proactive learning suggestions based on interaction patterns.
* Integration with various communication channels (chatbots, email, internal tools).
* Role-based access control for the review UI.
* Support for multi-turn conversations in the review process.
